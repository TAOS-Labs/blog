      <description>And We&amp;rsquo;re Live! I remember how this madness began. I had just finished speaking with Dr. Gheith and learned that we would receive no starter code. None. Zero. Nil. Naturally, my first question was, how do we boot?&#xA;I had previously taken CS439 with Dr. Norman, and while we did briefly - for a whole of five minutes - discuss how operating systems begin their lifecycle, it was by far not enough knowledge to go out and write ourselves a bootloader from scratch.</description>

      <description>Why have an SD Card at all When we started with TAOS we were trying to run on x86 laptops. The one we had focused on was a laptop that had eMMC storage, so since eMMC is basically a fancy SD card, The first thing I worked on was an SD card driver that could read and write blocks to unblock the file system people.&#xA;Useful reading The SD association provides simplified specifications, they might not be enough to use for a commercial grade operating system, but they are good enough to use for hobby operating systems.</description>
